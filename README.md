# Smart Shopping Cart

## About the project
The goals of our project are to help customers keep track of their expenses whilst shopping, by having the total sum displayed on a screen on their shopping cart, which makes their whole experience in the shop much easier and faster, and limit the need of cashiers. We do this with a Raspberry Pi camera, which uses a YOLO model. This is an AI model, which we've taught to recognise certain groceries.
